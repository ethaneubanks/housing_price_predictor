## Predicting Housing Price Per Square Foot Using Tabular Machine Learning Models

## I am Ethan Eubanks, a student at the University of Florida and this project predicts housing price per square foot using real home sales data from King County, Washington. I’m using simple tabular features like square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and year built to model how efficiently space is priced. I am doing this project to further my knowledge about the critial factors that influence the price of a house so that I may be better informed in my career moving forward.
